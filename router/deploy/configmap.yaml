# Model assignment configuration
#
# Two modes:
# 1. Replica-based (flexible): specify how many copies, router picks nodes
# 2. Node-based (explicit): specify exactly which nodes should have the model
#
# Models are processed by priority (higher first) to ensure important
# models get placed before less important ones.
